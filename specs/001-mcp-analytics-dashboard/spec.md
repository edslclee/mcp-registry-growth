# Feature Specification: MCP Server Analytics Dashboard

**Feature Branch**: `001-mcp-analytics-dashboard`
**Created**: 2025-10-28
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "We are building a one page web app that is going to list the MCP server analytics. We will be using the existing MCP Registry API to aggregate the data regularly and then present it to the user on one rich-formated page with graphs. Page should be dark themed, it should be modern color scheme(puple, blue, pink) There are always ways to filter the servers by local or remote and that will reflect in the charts. The charts are timecharts - date on the X axis counts on the Y axis, with hourly granularity. Granularity can also be switched - we can have hourly, daily, weekly, monthly. Because the counts are 'latest snapshots' we can always rely on the latest value. The site also should have an about page."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - View Server Analytics Overview (Priority: P1)

Users want to quickly understand the current state and growth trends of MCP servers to assess ecosystem health and adoption patterns.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition - providing visibility into MCP server metrics. Without this, the dashboard has no purpose.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by loading the dashboard and viewing the default time-series charts showing server counts over time, and delivers immediate value by showing current ecosystem state.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the user opens the dashboard, **When** the page loads, **Then** they see time-series charts displaying MCP server counts with dates on X-axis and counts on Y-axis
2. **Given** the user is viewing the dashboard, **When** they observe the charts, **Then** they see data visualized with hourly granularity by default
3. **Given** the user is viewing charts, **When** they look at the visual design, **Then** they see a dark theme with modern purple, blue, and pink color scheme
4. **Given** the user wants current data, **When** the page loads, **Then** they see the latest snapshot values from the MCP Registry API

### User Story 2 - Filter by Server Type (Priority: P2)

Users need to compare local vs remote server adoption to understand deployment patterns and make informed decisions about which server types to prioritize.

**Why this priority**: Filtering provides critical context for understanding the data, but the dashboard is still useful without it showing all servers together.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by selecting local/remote filter options and verifying that all charts update to reflect only the selected server type.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the user is viewing the dashboard, **When** they select "Local servers" filter, **Then** all charts update to show only local server metrics
2. **Given** the user is viewing the dashboard, **When** they select "Remote servers" filter, **Then** all charts update to show only remote server metrics
3. **Given** the user has applied a filter, **When** they select "All servers", **Then** the charts return to showing combined metrics
4. **Given** the user switches between filters, **When** the filter changes, **Then** the chart data updates smoothly without page reload

### User Story 3 - Adjust Time Granularity (Priority: P3)

Users want to analyze trends at different time scales (hourly, daily, weekly, monthly) to identify patterns ranging from immediate spikes to long-term growth trajectories.

**Why this priority**: While valuable for deeper analysis, users can still gain insights from the default hourly view. This enhances but doesn't define the core experience.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by switching between granularity options (hourly, daily, weekly, monthly) and verifying that chart X-axis and data aggregation update accordingly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the user is viewing hourly data, **When** they select "Daily" granularity, **Then** the chart re-aggregates data to show daily snapshots
2. **Given** the user is viewing daily data, **When** they select "Weekly" granularity, **Then** the chart re-aggregates data to show weekly snapshots
3. **Given** the user is viewing weekly data, **When** they select "Monthly" granularity, **Then** the chart re-aggregates data to show monthly snapshots
4. **Given** the user switches granularity, **When** a filter is already applied, **Then** the new granularity respects the active filter
5. **Given** the user changes granularity multiple times, **When** each change occurs, **Then** the transition is smooth and chart remains readable

---

### User Story 4 - Learn About the Dashboard (Priority: P4)

Users want to understand what the dashboard shows, data sources, update frequency, and how to interpret the metrics.

**Why this priority**: Context is helpful but not critical for using the dashboard. Users can derive value from the visualizations even without reading documentation.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by navigating to the About page and verifying that it contains clear information about the dashboard purpose, data sources, and usage.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the user is on the main dashboard, **When** they click "About", **Then** they navigate to an About page
2. **Given** the user is on the About page, **When** they read the content, **Then** they learn about the MCP Registry API data source, update frequency, and metric definitions
3. **Given** the user is on the About page, **When** they want to return, **Then** they can easily navigate back to the main dashboard
4. **Given** the user is on either page, **When** they look for navigation, **Then** the navigation between Dashboard and About is clear and consistent

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the MCP Registry API is unavailable or returns no data?
- How does the system handle date ranges where no data exists (e.g., before servers were tracked)?
- What happens if a user switches filters and granularity rapidly in succession?
- How does the dashboard behave on very small screens (mobile phones)?
- What happens when the latest snapshot is delayed or stale?
- How are timezone differences handled in the time-series data?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST display time-series charts with dates on the X-axis and server counts on the Y-axis
- **FR-002**: System MUST fetch data from the MCP Registry API endpoint that provides server snapshot data
- **FR-003**: System MUST use "latest snapshot" values for displaying current counts
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide filter options for "All servers", "Local servers", and "Remote servers"
- **FR-005**: System MUST update all charts when a filter is applied
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide granularity options for hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly views
- **FR-007**: System MUST default to hourly granularity on initial load
- **FR-008**: System MUST aggregate data appropriately when granularity changes (e.g., daily view shows one data point per day)
- **FR-009**: System MUST apply the dark theme across all pages
- **FR-010**: System MUST use a modern color scheme incorporating purple, blue, and pink
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide an About page with dashboard information
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide clear navigation between the Dashboard and About pages
- **FR-013**: System MUST handle API errors gracefully with user-friendly messages
- **FR-014**: System MUST display loading states while fetching data
- **FR-015**: System MUST be responsive across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices

### Key Entities

- **MCP Server**: Represents a server in the MCP ecosystem, classified as either "local" or "remote"
- **Snapshot**: Represents a point-in-time count of MCP servers, with timestamp and count values
- **Time Series**: Collection of snapshots over time, can be aggregated at different granularities (hourly, daily, weekly, monthly)
- **Filter State**: Represents the user's current view preferences (server type selection, time granularity)

### Assumptions

- The MCP Registry API provides historical snapshot data with timestamps
- API responses include a server type field (local/remote) or can be distinguished
- Data aggregation for different granularities will use the latest snapshot value within each time bucket
- The dashboard will be a single-page application with client-side routing for the About page
- API updates occur regularly enough that hourly granularity is meaningful
- Timezone for data display will be user's local timezone
- Chart library selection deferred to implementation phase (constitution principle: minimal dependencies)
- Specific API endpoint URL and authentication requirements will be determined during the planning phase
